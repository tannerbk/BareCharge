Digitized waveforms from an oscilloscope Lecroy Waverunner 606Zi are written to 
.hdf5 files using the lecrunch software package 
(T. LaTorre: https://bitbucket.org/tlatorre/lecrunch). 

The .hdf5 are opened and the attributes are read in. Then this code loops
through the digitized waveforms, and builds charge and average waveform histograms. 

Example use: 
./calc_charge filename.txt histo.root 2000 channel1 

Where filename.txt contains a list of .hdf5 for analysis, histo.root contains
the output ROOT histograms, 2000 is the length of the pedestal window in time-bin 
units, and channel1 is the oscilloscope channel to be processed.
